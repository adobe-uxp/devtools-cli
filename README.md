# Overview

UXP Devtools is a standard tool for rapid Adobe UXP plugin development. UXP Devtools provides the ability to do all of the following:

- **Discover** UXP-compatible Adobe apps.
- **Load** your development plugins in a target app (no symlinks or deep file system spelunking required).
- **Reload** your currently running plugin instance with new changes (no app restart required).
- **Launch** a rich DevTools environment for debugging your plugin.
- **View** your plugin logs.
